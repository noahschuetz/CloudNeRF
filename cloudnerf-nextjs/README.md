# CloudNeRF Next.js project

## Prerequisites

1. Node installed on your machine (preferrably using nvm)
2. (optional) VSCode for seamless use of dev dependencies (tailwindcss, biome)

## Getting Started

1. Clone repository
2. `cd` into repository
3. Run `npm install`
4. Run `npm run dev`
5. Go to http://localhost:3000 in your browser (the port may differ if you are already have a process running on port 3000)

## Dev Dependencies

### [Biome](https://biomejs.dev/)

As a linter we use Biome.

The executable is already installed with the `npm install` command above. The configuration of Biome can be found in `@/biome.json` (`@` refers to the root directory of the project).

Install the Biome VSCode extension for features like format on save etc.

### [Tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/)

Tailwindcss provides utility classes for faster design prototyping. E.g. add the class `p-2` to an HTML element to add a padding of 0.5rem on all sides.

The use of Tailwindcss is optional, and it is still possible to use standard ways of styling components (e.g. using the `styles` prop).

Tailwindcss is optimized for use in an IDE like VSCode. For best dev experience use the Tailwindcss VSCode extension. There should also be extensions for other IDEs.

### [Ant Design](https://ant.design/)

Ant Design is a component library for React (Next.js is a React Framework). Ant Design is install already via `npm install` (see above), so no further setup necessary

### [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)

Typescript is a superset of javascript. It provides type information which enables faster error detection directly IDE. Things like typos are detected directly.

The typescript config is found in `@/tsconfig.json`. If you find that Typescript is making things harder rather than easier simply set the `string` option in the config file to `false`

# README.md generated by `create-next-app` (kept for reference)

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
